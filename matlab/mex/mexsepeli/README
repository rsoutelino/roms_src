To compile on x86 or x86_64 Linux with g77 as the fortran compiler:
    Copy the mexopts.sh file from ${MATLAB}/bin directory into the 
    current directory.

    Uncomment the FFLAGS line down at the bottom, make it read
        FFLAGS="-g -fno-second-underscore $FFLAGS"

    At the unix command line, type "make linux"

    I'd strongly recommend using g77 over g95 or gfortran for the time
    being...

To compile on x86 Linux with gfortran as the fortran compiler:

    Copy the mexopts.sh file from ${MATLAB}/bin directory into the 
    current directory.

    Uncomment the FFLAGS line down at the bottom, make it read
        FFLAGS="-g -fno-second-underscore $FFLAGS"

    Uncomment the FC setting down at the bottom, make it read
        FC="gfortran"

    At the unix command line, type "make linux"

    current directory.

        FFLAGS="-g -fno-second-underscore $FFLAGS"

    Uncomment the FC setting down at the bottom, make it read
        FC="g95"

    I also had to make changes in the glnx86 section, having to change

            CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm -lstdc++"
            FLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm -lstdc++"

    to

            CLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6"
            FLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6"

    I don't quite understand why.

    At the unix command line, type "make linux"

To compile on solaris with Sun WorkShop 6, at the unix command line, 
type "make sol"
